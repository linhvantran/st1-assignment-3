# Stage 12 activities and evidence

BLANK student response template. Supplied from the beginning in stage12/ in your EXISTING repository; complete it only when you reach Stage 12 after the previous applicable stage is integrated, verified and recorded; preserve project/, tests, earlier records and Git history. UG/common and PG/extended scope must be explicit. Use concise results and versioned links, not copied logs or source. No staff answers or fabricated approvals.

Optional bounded-change practice only: validation rule, focused test, safe error-message change, explicit-input query or agreed status rule with test. Explain expected impact before editing, make a small change, run the test, and identify evidence to inspect if unsure. No live AI unless explicitly permitted. Preserve the submitted candidate.

Practice question/change and reasoning: [response or not undertaken]
Separate reflection / peer / common team viva evidence links and routing: [response]
No further coding stage. Later corrections use the published assessment process.
